You know about carquery api right? they manage car year make model.

I want to design a same system for only year, make, model, model variant with my node-express-mongoose backend.

I want the functionality to be just like that of car query.

I will get the year and view all the makes of that year
I will get the make and year and get all the model pointing to the make and year
I will get make, year and, model and all the model-variant of that year, make and model.

Give me step by step guideline
